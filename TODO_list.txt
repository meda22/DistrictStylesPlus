- fix UI refreshes after deleting style
- check that refreshes working fine after UI actions
- Add option that style is restrictive - allows only buildings in style for given zone
- Check if possible to allow building level up on same prefab without historical option

- check include all button - it seems it is removing all not-downloaded assets from style


IMPROVING OF SAVING OF STYLE
- changes in style should be saved in only following cases:
    1. when new style button is clicked
    2. when different style is selected
    3. when editor window is closed
    4. when editor is toggled (Toggle method)
    
- add possibility to enable/disable "saving question" - each above mentioned actions will raise a question if save changes

- add saving question to style selection window on "x" close
